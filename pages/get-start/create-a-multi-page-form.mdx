# Create a multi-page form

With Makeform, you have the flexibility to create either a single-page form, displaying all questions together,
or a multi-page form that presents one question per page. You can also combine styles, placing multiple questions
on some pages. By default, new forms start as single-page, but if youâ€™d prefer showing one question at a time,
follow the instructions below.

## What is a multi-page form?

Form builders like Typeform often display one question per page, allowing respondents to concentrate on individual questions
and creating a more interactive, conversational feel. This is known as a multi-page form.

## How to create multiple pages

Makeform offers complete freedom to organize your form pages however you like.

- Using AI: You can enter the prompt "Please add a new page and add a short text with label 'Your Name'. "
- Manually: You can click the <span className="text-slate-500 font-bold bg-slate-200 px-2 py-1 rounded">+</span> button to add a new page.
