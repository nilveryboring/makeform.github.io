## How to Rename Forms

### Overview

When you create a form, MakeForm automatically generates the form's title based on your conversation with the AI chatbot. You can rename forms at any time for better organization without affecting what your respondents see.

**From your form's details page:**

1. Open your form by clicking on it from the dashboard

This will update the form name that appears in your dashboard and throughout the MakeForm editor.

> **Important:** Renaming your form only changes its internal name for your organization. To change what your respondents see when they open your form, you'll need to customize the share title (see below).

### Understanding Form Names vs. Share Titles

MakeForm uses two different naming systems:

**Form Name (Internal)**
- What you see in your dashboard and editor
- Used for organizing and identifying your forms
- Not visible to respondents
- Can be changed anytime using the Rename option

**Share Title (Public)**
- What appears in the browser tab when respondents view your form
- Displayed in social media previews when you share your form link
- Shown in search engine results
- Can be customized from the Share page (Pro feature)

To customize your share title, image, and favicon for link previews, see [Link Preview](/features/link-preview).
