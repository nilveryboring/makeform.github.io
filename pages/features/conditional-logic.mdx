**What you can do with conditional logic:**

- ✅ Route respondents to different pages based on their answers
- ✅ Create branching paths for quizzes, surveys, and assessments
- ✅ Skip irrelevant sections automatically
- ✅ Build complex multi-path forms without multiple separate forms

## What is Conditional Logic?

Conditional logic lets you create smart forms that adapt to each respondent's answers. Instead of showing everyone the same linear path, you can direct people to different pages or sections based on how they respond.

### Common Use Cases

**Quizzes & Assessments**
Route quiz-takers to different result pages based on their score or answers.

**Customer Feedback**
If someone rates their experience poorly, direct them to a detailed feedback page. If they rate it highly, skip to a simple thank-you page.

**Lead Qualification**
Send qualified leads to a detailed intake form, while directing others to a waiting list or alternative path.

**Conditional Surveys**
Only show follow-up questions relevant to the respondent's previous answers.

## How to Add Conditional Logic

### Step 1: Navigate to a Form Page

Open your form in the builder and navigate to the page where you want to add conditional logic.

### Step 2: Create Your First Condition

![Locate Add Logic Button](/images/conditional_logic2.png)

To add conditional logic, look for the <span className="text-cyan-500 font-bold bg-cyan-100 px-2 py-1 rounded">Add conditional logic to this page</span> button at the bottom of the page, right below the "Next/Submit" button. This button only appears when you hover your mouse over the area. Click it to open the condition settings.

![Condition Settings](/images/conditional_logic3.png)

Configure your condition with the following settings:

1. <span className="text-cyan-500 font-bold bg-cyan-100 px-2 py-1 rounded">Field</span> - Select which field's answer to check
2. <span className="text-cyan-500 font-bold bg-cyan-100 px-2 py-1 rounded">Operator</span> - Choose how to compare (equals, not equals, or contains)
3. <span className="text-cyan-500 font-bold bg-cyan-100 px-2 py-1 rounded">Value</span> - Enter the value to compare against
4. <span className="text-cyan-500 font-bold bg-cyan-100 px-2 py-1 rounded">Go to</span> - Select the destination page or choose to end the form
5. <span className="text-cyan-500 font-bold bg-cyan-100 px-2 py-1 rounded">Default Action</span> - Set what happens when the condition doesn't match (typically continues to the next page)

### Available Operators

<Callout type="info">
Choose the operator that matches your condition type:
</Callout>

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Equals** | Exact match | Rating equals "Satisfied" |
| **Not Equals** | Does not match | Status not equals "Pending" |
| **Contains** | Text or array includes value | Answer contains "Yes" |

## Visualizing Your Logic Flow

![Logic Flow Visualization](/images/conditional_logic4.png)

See your entire form's conditional logic in a visual flowchart:

1. Click the <span className="text-cyan-500 font-bold bg-cyan-100 px-2 py-1 rounded">Logic Flow</span> tab in the form builder
2. View your pages and conditional paths as a connected diagram
3. Click any page node to navigate to it in the editor

**Visual Elements:**
- **Solid lines** - Standard page progression
- **Dashed lines** - Conditional navigation paths
- **Dotted lines** - Default fallback paths

## Troubleshooting

### Condition Not Working?

**Check the field name**
- Ensure you're referencing the correct field
- Field names are case-sensitive

**Verify the operator**
- Use "equals" for exact text matches
- Use "contains" for partial matches
- Use "not equals" to exclude specific values

**Test with preview**
- Use form preview to test your conditions
- Fill out the form as a respondent would
- Verify each path works correctly

### Logic Not Triggering?

**Confirm logic placement**
- Logic must be on the page with the trigger question
- Logic evaluates when the "Next" button is clicked

**Check condition order**
- Remember: First matching condition wins
- Reorder conditions if needed

**Review data types**
- Comparing numbers with text won't work
- Ensure your values match the field's data type
