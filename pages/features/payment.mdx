## What do I need to collect payments?

To collect payments through your Makeform forms, you need:

1. **A Makeform account** (Free or Pro)
2. **A Stripe account** (free to create at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com))

Makeform uses Stripe to process payments securely. Stripe is a trusted payment platform used by millions of businesses worldwide. When you connect your Stripe account to Makeform, payments go directly to your Stripe account, and Makeform never stores sensitive payment information.

### Connect your Stripe account

Before you can add a payment field to your form, you'll need to connect your Stripe account:

1. Go to your Makeform **Settings** or **Integrations** page
2. Click **Connect Stripe**
3. You'll be redirected to Stripe to authorize the connection
4. Once connected, you can start adding payment fields to your forms

<Callout type="info">
If you don't have a Stripe account yet, you can create one for free during the connection process.
</Callout>

---

## Payment fees

Makeform charges an application fee on top of standard Stripe payment processing fees:

- **Free plan**: 5% application fee
- **Pro plan**: 0% application fee (no markup)

**Stripe's standard processing fees** apply to all transactions:
- 2.9% + $0.30 per successful card charge (US)
- Fees vary by country and payment method

<Callout type="info">
For complete Stripe pricing details, visit [stripe.com/pricing](https://stripe.com/pricing).
</Callout>

---

## Add payment to your form

Adding a payment field to your form is simple:

### Using AI

You can ask the AI to add a payment field to your form:

```
"Add a payment field for $50"
"Add a payment field with dynamic pricing based on quantity"
```

The AI will add the payment field and configure it based on your instructions.

### Manual setup

1. Open your form in the editor
2. Click the **Add field** button or the **+** button between fields
3. Select **Payment** from the field type menu
4. Configure your payment settings (amount, currency, etc.)
5. Click **Save**

<Callout type="warning">
The payment field is always required. Make sure to place it strategically in your form, typically as one of the last fields.
</Callout>

## Payment settings

### Amount type

You can set up payments in two ways:

#### Fixed amount

Set a specific price that never changes. Perfect for:
- Registration fees
- Product purchases with set prices
- Membership dues
- Ticket sales

**Example:** Event registration fee of $25.00

#### Dynamic amount

Calculate the price based on other fields in your form. Perfect for:
- Quantity-based pricing (e.g., number of tickets × price per ticket)
- Donation forms where users choose their amount
- Custom calculations based on selections

**Example:** Number of attendees × $25.00 per person

See [Dynamic pricing](#dynamic-pricing) for more details.

---

### Currency

Makeform supports all currencies available through Stripe, including:

- USD (US Dollar)
- EUR (Euro)
- GBP (British Pound)
- JPY (Japanese Yen)
- AUD (Australian Dollar)
- CAD (Canadian Dollar)
- And [100+ more currencies](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies)

The currency symbol will automatically display based on your selection.

---

### Payment methods

Your payment field automatically supports multiple payment methods:

- **Credit and debit cards** (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, etc.)
- **Apple Pay** (when available on the user's device)
- **Google Pay** (when available on the user's browser)

Payment methods are automatically shown based on what's available to the respondent. For example, Apple Pay only appears for users on Apple devices with Apple Pay set up.

All payment methods are processed securely through Stripe with full PCI compliance.

---

### Email receipts

You can automatically send payment receipts to your respondents:

1. Add an **Email input** field to your form
2. In the payment field settings, select that email field for receipts
3. Stripe will automatically send a receipt to that email address after successful payment

If you don't configure this, respondents can enter their email address directly in the payment form to receive a receipt.

---

## View payments

After respondents submit payments, you can view them in two places:

### In Makeform

1. Open your form
2. Go to the **Responses** tab
3. Each submission shows the payment status and amount
4. Click on a submission to view full details

### In Stripe

All payment details are available in your Stripe dashboard:

1. Log in to your [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
2. Go to **Payments** to see all transactions
3. Each payment includes the form submission data as metadata

Your Stripe dashboard provides complete payment information including:
- Transaction details and fees
- Customer information
- Refund options
- Dispute management
- Financial reports

---

## Dynamic pricing

<Callout type="info">
Dynamic pricing allows you to calculate payment amounts based on other fields in your form, such as quantity inputs, number selectors, or custom calculations.
</Callout>

### How it works

1. Add fields that will be used for calculation (e.g., a number input for quantity)
2. Add a payment field to your form
3. Set the amount type to **Dynamic**
4. Select which field to calculate from
5. Optionally set minimum and maximum amounts

### Use cases

**Quantity-based pricing:**
- Event tickets: Number of tickets × $50.00
- Product orders: Quantity × unit price
- Per-person fees: Number of attendees × registration fee

**Tiered pricing:**
- Calculate different rates based on number input
- Combine with conditional logic for complex pricing

**Donation forms:**
- Let users choose their donation amount
- Set minimum donation amounts

### Example setup

For a workshop charging $75 per attendee:

1. Add a **Number input** field asking "How many attendees?"
2. Add a **Payment** field
3. Configure the payment field:
   - Amount type: Dynamic
   - Calculate from: "How many attendees?" field
   - Multiply by: 75.00
   - Currency: USD
   - Minimum amount: $75.00 (at least 1 attendee)

The payment amount will automatically update as respondents change their quantity selection.
