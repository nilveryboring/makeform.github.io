# Custom Domain

Use your own domain for your forms instead of the default makeform.ai domain.

---

**What you get with custom domains:**

- ✅ Professional branded form URLs (e.g., `forms.yourcompany.com`)
- ✅ Automatic SSL certificates for secure HTTPS connections
- ✅ Quick setup with just one CNAME record

<Callout type="info">
Custom domains is a **Pro feature**.

<Callout type="info">
**Recommendation:** We suggest using a **subdomain** (like `forms.yourcompany.com`) to avoid conflicts with your main website and for easier setup.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Add CNAME Record to Your DNS Provider

After adding your domain, you'll receive DNS configuration instructions.

### How to Add the CNAME Record

1. **Log in to your domain provider** (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, Google Domains)
2. **Navigate to DNS settings** (usually called "DNS Management", "DNS Records", or "Advanced DNS")
3. **Add a new record** with the following details:
   - **Type**: CNAME
   - **Name/Host**: Your subdomain (e.g., `forms`)
   - **Value/Target**: `cname.makeform.ai`
   - **TTL**: Auto or 3600 (1 hour)
4. **Save the changes**

<Callout type="info">
**Need help?** Use the **Check DNS Propagation** link in your dashboard to verify your DNS changes, or consult the **Vercel Domain Docs** for detailed provider-specific instructions.
</Callout>

### Important Notes

- **DNS propagation**: DNS changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate globally, though most changes are visible within 1-2 hours
- **SSL certificates**: Will be automatically provisioned once DNS is configured
- **Verification**: You can check verification status using the "Check Verification" button

<Callout type="warning">
The domain status will show as **Pending** until the DNS records are detected. This is normal - just wait for DNS propagation.
</Callout>

---

## Step 5: Verify and Wait for Completion

Once DNS is configured, click **Check Verification** to verify your domain.

### Verification Process

1. Wait 5-15 minutes after adding the CNAME record
2. Click **Check Verification** button in your dashboard
3. If DNS has propagated, the domain will be verified
4. SSL certificate will be automatically provisioned

### Domain Status Indicators

Your domain will show different statuses during the setup process:

| Status | Indicator | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| 🟢 **Verified** | Green badge with ✓ checkmark | Domain is fully verified, SSL certificate active, and ready to use |
| 🟠 **Pending** | Orange outline with ⏰ clock icon | DNS records not yet detected or still propagating |
| 🔵 **Configuring** | Blue outline with ⚙️ settings icon | DNS detected, SSL certificate being provisioned |

### When Complete

You'll see:
- ✅ Status changes to **Verified** (green checkmark)
- ✅ Message: "Domain is verified and ready to use!"
- ✅ Timestamps for Added, Last Checked, and Verified dates
