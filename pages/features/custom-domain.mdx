# Custom Domain

Use your own domain for your forms instead of the default makeform.ai domain.

---

**What you get with custom domains:**

- ✅ Professional branded form URLs (e.g., `forms.yourcompany.com`)
- ✅ Automatic SSL certificates for secure HTTPS connections
- ✅ Quick setup with just one CNAME record

<Callout type="info">
Custom domains is a **Pro feature**.
</Callout>

## Step 1: Access the Domains Page

Navigate to the Domains section from your dashboard sidebar.

![Domains Page](/images/custom_domain1.png)

1. Log in to your Makeform account
2. Click on **Domains** in the left sidebar navigation
3. Click **Add Your First Domain** (or **Add Domain** if you already have domains)

---

## Step 2: Choose Your Domain Type

Select whether you want to use a subdomain or root domain.

![Choose Domain Type](/images/custom_domain2.png)

<Callout type="info">
**Recommendation:** We suggest using a **subdomain** (like `forms.yourcompany.com`) to avoid conflicts with your main website and for easier setup.
</Callout>

---

## Step 3: Enter Your Domain

After selecting your domain type, enter your domain details.

![Enter Domain](/images/custom_domain3.png)

<Callout type="warning">
After adding your domain, you'll need to update your DNS settings to point to Vercel. Detailed instructions will be provided once the domain is added.
</Callout>

Click **Add Domain** to proceed.

## Step 4: Add CNAME Record to Your DNS Provider

After adding your domain, you'll receive DNS configuration instructions.

![DNS Setup Instructions](/images/custom_domain4.png)

### How to Add the CNAME Record

1. **Log in to your domain provider** (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, Google Domains)
2. **Navigate to DNS settings** (usually called "DNS Management", "DNS Records", or "Advanced DNS")
3. **Add a new record** with the following details:
   - **Type**: CNAME
   - **Name/Host**: Your subdomain (e.g., `forms`)
   - **Value/Target**: `cname.makeform.ai`
   - **TTL**: Auto or 3600 (1 hour)
4. **Save the changes**

<Callout type="info">
**Need help?** Use the **Check DNS Propagation** link in your dashboard to verify your DNS changes, or consult the **Vercel Domain Docs** for detailed provider-specific instructions.
</Callout>

### Important Notes

- **DNS propagation**: DNS changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate globally, though most changes are visible within 1-2 hours
- **SSL certificates**: Will be automatically provisioned once DNS is configured
- **Verification**: You can check verification status using the "Check Verification" button

<Callout type="warning">
The domain status will show as **Pending** until the DNS records are detected. This is normal - just wait for DNS propagation.
</Callout>

---

## Step 5: Verify and Wait for Completion

Once DNS is configured, click **Check Verification** to verify your domain.

![Domain Verified](/images/custom_domain5.png)

### Verification Process

1. Wait 5-15 minutes after adding the CNAME record
2. Click **Check Verification** button in your dashboard
3. If DNS has propagated, the domain will be verified
4. SSL certificate will be automatically provisioned

### Domain Status Indicators

Your domain will show different statuses during the setup process:

| Status | Indicator | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| 🟢 **Verified** | Green badge with ✓ checkmark | Domain is fully verified, SSL certificate active, and ready to use |
| 🟠 **Pending** | Orange outline with ⏰ clock icon | DNS records not yet detected or still propagating |
| 🔵 **Configuring** | Blue outline with ⚙️ settings icon | DNS detected, SSL certificate being provisioned |

### When Complete

You'll see:
- ✅ Status changes to **Verified** (green checkmark)
- ✅ Message: "Domain is verified and ready to use!"
- ✅ Timestamps for Added, Last Checked, and Verified dates

<Callout type="success">
**Your custom domain is now live!** Your forms are now accessible at your custom domain with automatic HTTPS encryption.
</Callout>

## Using Your Custom Domain with Forms

Once your domain is verified, you can assign it to your forms to create professional branded URLs.

## Assign Custom Domain to a Form

Navigate to the Share page of the form you want to use with your custom domain.

![Form Share Page - Domain Selector](/images/custom_domain7.png)

1. Open your form in the form builder
2. Click on the **Share** tab in the top navigation
3. Find the **Custom Domain** section
4. Click the domain dropdown to select from your verified domains

<Callout type="info">
Only **verified domains** will appear in the dropdown. Make sure you've completed the domain verification process first.
</Callout>

After selecting a domain, your form will be accessible at:
```
https://yourdomain.com/f/{form-id}
```

For example: `https://forms.company.com/f/abc123`

---

## Customizing Form URLs with Custom Paths

Take your branded URLs to the next level by creating clean, memorable paths instead of using the default form ID format.

### What are Custom Paths?

Custom paths let you replace the `/f/{form-id}` format with your own custom URL path:

- **Default format**: `https://yourdomain.com/f/abc123xyz`
- **Custom path**: `https://yourdomain.com/contact`
- **Another example**: `https://yourdomain.com/feedback`

## Enable Custom Paths

After assigning a custom domain to your form, enable the custom paths feature.

![Enable Custom Paths](/images/custom_domain8.png)

1. In the form Share page, locate the **Custom Paths** toggle
2. Click the toggle to enable custom path URLs
3. The custom path input field will appear

<Callout type="info">
Custom paths are only available when you have a **custom domain assigned** to your form. The toggle will not be active for forms using the default makeform.ai domain.
</Callout>

---

## Create Your Custom Path

Enter your desired path and save it to create a branded URL.

![Create Custom Path](/images/custom_domain9.png)

1. **Enter your path** in the input field (e.g., `contact`, `feedback`, `apply`)
2. The system will **validate your path** in real-time:
   - **✓ Green checkmark** — path is available
   - **✗ Red X** — path is taken or invalid
3. **Preview your URL** below the input field
4. Click **Save Path** to create the custom path

### Path Rules and Guidelines

When creating custom paths, follow these rules:

**Allowed characters:**
- Letters (a-z, A-Z)
- Numbers (0-9)
- Hyphens (-)
- Underscores (_)
- Forward slashes (/) for nested paths

**Reserved paths** that cannot be used:
- `api`, `admin`, `auth`, `f`, `e`
- `_next`, `favicon.ico`, `robots.txt`
- And other system-reserved paths

<Callout type="warning">
Paths are **case-sensitive** and must be unique within each domain. Two forms on the same domain cannot use the same path.
</Callout>
