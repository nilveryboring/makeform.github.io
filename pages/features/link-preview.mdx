## Link Preview

### Overview

When you share your MakeForm link on social media platforms, messaging apps, or search engines, a link preview is automatically generated. This preview includes a title, description, and image that gives people a glimpse of your form before they click.

Customizing your link preview helps your form stand out and provides context about what respondents can expect when they open it.

### What is a Link Preview?

A link preview (also known as an Open Graph preview or social card) is the visual summary that appears when you share a URL on platforms like:

- **Social media**: Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram

The preview typically includes:
- A title (shown in browser tabs and preview cards)

- A favicon (small icon in browser tabs)

### Platform-Specific Behavior

Different platforms may display your link preview slightly differently:

**Social Media Platforms** (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter/X):
- Display title, description, and Open Graph image
- May cache previews for several hours
- Twitter/X uses "summary_large_image" card format

**Messaging Apps** (Slack, Discord, WhatsApp):
- Show title and image prominently
- Description may be truncated
- Some apps cache aggressively

**Search Engines** (Google):
- Use title and description for search results
- May use Open Graph image for featured results
- Favicon appears next to your URL in search results

**Note**: After updating your link preview settings, some platforms may take time to refresh their cached version. You can use each platform's preview refresh tools to force an update.
